# hello-react-bootstrap

A collection of "Hello World" samples of React.
Most of the codes are drawn from
[React Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html)
but with some modification to apply Bootstrap styles to UI elements using
`react-bootstrap`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Please refer to `CRA-README.md` for CRA-related stuff.
